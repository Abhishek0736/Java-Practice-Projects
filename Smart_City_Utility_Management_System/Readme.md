# 🏙 Smart City Utility Management System (Java Console App)

A **menu-driven Java console application** that simulates a real-world **Smart City Utility Billing System**.  
The project manages **electricity, water, and gas bills** for city consumers using **slab-based billing logic**.

This project is designed to strengthen **Java fundamentals** and demonstrate **problem-solving skills** in a real-world scenario.

## 🧮 Billing Logic

### ⚡ Electricity Bill
| Units | Rate |
|------|------|
| 0 – 100 | ₹5 / unit |
| 101 – 300 | ₹8 / unit |
| 300+ | ₹10 / unit |

### 💧 Water Bill
| Usage (Liters) | Rate |
|---------------|------|
| 0 – 500 | ₹2 / liter |
| 501 – 1000 | ₹5 / liter |
| 1000+ | ₹8 / liter |

### 🔥 Gas Bill
- ₹50 per kg
